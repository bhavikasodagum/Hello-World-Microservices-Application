# Hello-World-Microservices-Application

## Description
This project demonstrates a simple "Hello World" microservices application using Spring Boot (Java), Docker, and Kubernetes. It consists of two microservices:
- **Hello Service**: Returns a message ("Hello").
- **World Service**: Returns a message ("World").

These services are containerized using Docker and deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. An integration script combines their responses to display "Hello World".
